# Archipelago-Manuel-TheVault

Your team of cunning goblin engineers stands before **The Vault**, a treasure trove of mythical relics and unimaginable wealth. With a mix of wits, gadgets, and just the right amount of chaos, you’ll need to find the keys—or invent your own way inside. The question isn’t *if* you’ll crack The Vault, but *how much havoc* you’ll cause getting there.

## How To Play
* In your YAML, set up how many Keys you need to find and how much Treasure **The Vault** contains
  * *Be warned that the more items are in The Vault, the longer generation might be since you will be locking ALL of the items behind GOAL*
* The Vault will either open when you find all the Vault Keys as defined in the YAML
* Some of your Goblin friends can come and help with some heavy-duty tools! There are items that are added to the pool that are worth a certain amount of Keys, for exemple "Bringing in the Explosives! (+10 Vault Keys)" is worth 10 Vault Keys to help your Progression
  * If the amount of Vault Keys you need to find is too low, some Helpers/Tools won't show up in the pool, to keep some balance  
* Once you have found all the required Keys, your goal is complete and you can loot all of the items!
